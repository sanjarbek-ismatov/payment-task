Project is being develop.
New features which came to my mind:

1. Notifications:
   It will have its own model, routes and so on.
   The model will be like that:
   `json
        {
            date: "the date when notification made",
            type: "transfer",
            "body": "Bla bla",
            wasItRead: false
        }
    `
   It came to user's dashboard and user can read, uncheck and clear all ones.
2. Particular page for each transfer to see all details.
